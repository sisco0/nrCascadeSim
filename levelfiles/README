The format of the files in this director are:

Each line represents an individual cascade realization for a capture. Each number in the line is defined as follows:

(total fraction): the absolute fraction that this cascade represents in this capture sample

(symbol for post-capture nucleus): like 71Ge represents the final nucleus after the capture

(A value for post-capture nucleus): This is redundant for now

(vector of the energy levels): these are the energy levels AFTER the neutron separation energy.

(vector of level lifetimes): these are the lifetimes in attoseconds of each intermediate level

Here is an example:


0.000671	29Si	29	[4840.4	0.0]	[3500	100000000000000]

Here, this cascade is meant to be simulated with an overall fraction of 0.07%. The capture happens
on 28-Si and proceeds with two emitted gammas. First a gamma is emitted by the difference
between the neutron separation energy and the 4840.4 keV. The next gamma is emitted between the
4840.4 level and the ground state.
