Using the code I've made to do a first-pass analysis of simple cascades, the purpose of the code
in this directory is to create a library that can be used to (quickly) generate arbitrary
non-continuum cascade realizations.  By "non-continuum" I mean ignoring the continuum contribution
and focusing only on cascades that are supplied in an input file, with specified relative
abundances and intermediate level details.

INPUT:

The input should consist of a file with several cascades listed and the relative weights of said
cascades.  In addition the user should specify how many realizations of the capture process are
desired. 

Here is a possible row of an input file

weight Sn [..,E2,E1,E0] [..,tau2,tau1,inf]

weight: weight of this cascade realization. It will be normalized to unity with all other cascades

Sn: neutron separation energy (MeV), can include several isotopes if energy different. 

[..,E2,E1,E0]: ordered list of the energy levels traversed (keV), including the ground state

[..,tau2,tau1,inf]: ordered list of the lifetimes of the energy levels traversed (fs), it must be
the same length as the previous list.



OUTPUT:

A file that contains the separate NR deposits, along with their Ionization deposits (see
N-MISC-16-001 pg 35).  In addition all of the exiting gamma energies and times should be listed.
